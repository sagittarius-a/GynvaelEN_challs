We've already learned not to rely on "agent Huffman's" ability to send us text
messages. So this time, we've asked him to take a picture of some secret 
documents and put them on a website. I mean, would could possibly go wrong,
right?

Well, he sent us this link:

  http://gynvael.vexillium.org/ext/thepicture/

Obviously we can't make heads or tails of it. Please help.

On a totally unrelated note, we're looking for new agents...

GOOD LUCK!

If you decode the answer, put it in the comments under this video! If you write
a blogpost / post your solution online, please add a link in the comments too!

P.S. I'll show/explain the solution on the stream next week.
